    "### Overview\n",
    "Missing data is defined to be non-ignorable if it is not missing at random. Non-ignorable missing data causes the inference based on observed data to lead to biased parameter estimates and can affect the significance of your results. This paper attempts to use probabilistic models to fill in missing data to reduce this bias\n",
    "\n",
    "### Example\n",
    "In the scenario where you have netflix movie ratings, you are more likely to rate movies that you really enjoy or really dislike, but rarely rate movies that you are neutral about. Therefore, most of the missing data tends to be from these middle ratings and the distribution of the observed data is shifted to the right from the true distribution of copmletely filled data. In this scenario, the probability of observing a particular response depends on the value itself. Therefore, ignoring missing data can lead to biased parameter estimates. "

For example, in data analyzing blood pressure or cholesterol, we may see that the probability of seeing missing values for younger, healthier people is higher than for older people because they are less likely to have health complications that require these measurements. Doctors may assume that these measurements are not necessary for the checkup and therefore the data will not be missing at random. In order to use this probabilistic model to fill in missing values, I need to understanding how these categorical variables (if you just convert them to integers) can represent a multinomial distribution. If a person's blood pressure can take the values [10, 50, 100], and our $\\theta = [.2 .2 .6]$, does this mean that the person's blood pressure = Multinomial($\\theta$, 1)? "
